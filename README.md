###  Distribution rules, highest priority first:

      4. [The build server](https://jenkins.dries007.net/job/MCLink/)
   2. You are allowed to _privately_ use a modified version while developing a Pull Request.
   3. A freely accessible platform is defined as a platform requiring no payment for access.
      So called "Premium" access (for example payment in exchange for removal of advertisements or faster downloads) is allowed.
   4. So called "Private modpacks" are allowed, provided they are not against rule 3. 
3. You cannot explicitly upload any build to any platform for monetary gain (such as using Adfly links, reward points, etc).
    1. CurseForge modpacks are allowed to enable Curse reward points, if they use the official build from CurseForge, and abide by the CurseForge Terms of Service.
5. Mod archives are allowed to archive official builds of the mod privately.
   If the official sources no longer offer a version or they inaccessible for 1 month, the builds may be publicly distributed.

Exceptions may be granted by written permission.
Such permission can be requested via any of the contact options listed on [the about page of the MCLink website](https://mclink.dries007.net/about).

If you come across a build you suspect does not adhere to these rules, please inform me. Thanks!

<!--
For the curious: A little background info on these rules:

- I don't want to get issue reports about builds I did not make.
- This mod uses my own backend service.
- I spend a lot of time and effort making this.
- The money I get from CurseForge's reward points helps pay for the server MCLink runs on.
